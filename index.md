**Adelego** is a project created to help dependent people live longer and more safely at home and improve the assistance caregivers can bring to dependent people.

>***What is dependence?***

 person is dependent if he/she is reliant on someone else to accomplish or complete common tasks, such as cooking meals. People become dependent because of their age, disability and/or an illness. Dependence can last a few days (e.g. after a surgery) or a lifetime (e.g. a person born with a mental disability).

>***What is a caregiver?***

A caregiver is a person who helps dependent people in their daily life. A caregiver can be a nurse, a family member, or even a neighbor. In most cases, a caregiver is the spouse or a parent of a dependent person. Due to the wide range of dependence, the job of a caregiver varies from person to person. 

### Our situation 
Populations in countries across Europe and the Americas are aging leading to an increase in the number of dependent people and consequently, caregivers. Today, it is estimated that about 1 in 5 people is a caregiver in Europe and North America and this number is expected to increase for the next few decades due to the aging of baby boomers and the overall decline of total fertility rates. This situation is not economically viable due to the increasing proportion of dependent people, but also the global impoverishment of the population and the high cost of health care.

We are looking for solutions to protect and support dependent people & their caregivers through the use of connected objects and the implementation of digital applications. We are convinced that we can provide real solutions for everyone's needs through cooperative work and exchange of good practices.
