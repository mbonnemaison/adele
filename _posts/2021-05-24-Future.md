« The future torments us, the past holds us back, that’s why the present escapes us » Gustave Flaubert

We all try to imagine what will happen, but our initial assumptions are based on our past experiences from which we try to project ourselves. How many times have we been wrong about our own projections ?

Rather than looking far ahead all the time, we believe we should have goals and embrace the present. We believe we should move forward step by step and ask ourselves if each step we overcome brings us closer to our goals.

Each of us has methods to be more aware of the present, solve daily problems with the best of his/her abilities and be the best person he/she can be. 

What is your method ?
