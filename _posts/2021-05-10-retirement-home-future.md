Aging represents a major cause of dependence that can radically change how elders live. According to the UN, there were about 703 million people over 65 including 143 million over 80 in 2019 worldwide. In 30 years, about 1.5 billion people will be over 65, representing about 16% of the world population.

When dependence becomes too important, our elders look for better accomodation (e.g. in retirement homes) to meet their needs. Unfortunately, this entire population cannot be accomodated in retirement homes due to limiting personal and public funds. Moreover, with the aging of baby-boomers, we know that the demand will be greater than in the past.

This brings up some questions: will we be able to meet this increasing demand in the years to come? If not, what solutions can we bring to face this societal phenomenon?
