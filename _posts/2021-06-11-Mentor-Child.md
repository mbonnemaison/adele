Nowadays, it is common for children to have both parents work. Throughout the week, both parents may not have enough time to help their children with homework, to listen to them, to guide them or play with them. Many retired people have received enough education to help children with homework, have time to listen to them and wisdom to share.

Would not it be possible for retired people to mentor a child ? Developing social bonds between generations has already shown to be beneficial for all three parties. The child then finds a surrogate grandparent, a confidant and a guardian to direct him/her. The parents can feel confident their children receive the help they need thanks to the retired person and consequently better perform at work. The retired person builds a relationship which is critical for well-being when aging.

Promoting such a relationship probably already exists in many communities. Can you identify an organization for such a relationship in your neighborhood ?
