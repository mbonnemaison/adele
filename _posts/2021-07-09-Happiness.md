In our society, it is perhaps easier to see the falling trees rather than the growing forest. We tend to only see devastating stories, like accidents, fires, terrorist attacks, etc. But, in each terrible event, the world continues to move forward with beautiful things happening constantly. 

If we want to live a more positive life, we must embrace and be grateful for each life event that presents to us, even the ones that hurt. By being aware of these moments, we become more thankful for what we have and more prone to accept and learn from our mistakes. We become a better person. It is up to us to appreciate each moment life gives us, whether it is pleasant or not. 

Do you have any suggestions on how to recognize these moments?
