Our society is aging and current solutions to prepare for the increase in the number of seniors are limited. Adelegoâ€™s goals are to present this growing societal problem, and find solutions with people willing to respond to this issue as best we can.

We value everyone's participation and want each and everyone to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, everyone is expected to show respect and courtesy to others.

# Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Being kind to others
- Behaving professionally
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Harassment of participants in any form
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following

- Sexual language and imagery in any conference venue, including talks
- Insults or put downs
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
