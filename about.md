- **Our Vision**: The elderly population is growing and the total fertility rate is in decline in many countries across the world. As a consequence, the proportion of people developing age-related pathologies and the number of caregivers are also on the rise. The current system won’t measure up to these upcoming societal challenges. We thus created Adelego to better meet the needs of dependent people and caregivers regardless of their age, of where they live or their financial situation.

- **Our Mission**: To solve this forthcoming issue, we want to develop solutions that are simple, robust, easy to use and affordable for dependent people and their caregivers. Because most elderly people want to stay at home as long as possible, we are first turning to the use of connected objects and the implementation of open-source applications to improve their safety and the assistance they receive from caregivers.

- **Our Values**: We are stronger when we work together and respect each other which is why Adelego is an open-source project. We cherish everyone’s ideas and contributions because we believe this is the best way to develop better solutions for dependent people and caregivers.
